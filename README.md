# Counter-Sign

## Description
In this challenge I will be creating a Password Generator application that my employees will be using to generate a random password based on the criteria they have chosen.
When the employee generates their password they can specify how long they would like their password to be, and whether they would like lowercase, uppercase, special characters or numeric characters in their password. All these will be prompts that will appear once they click on the generate password button.

## BuildPassword
Once the user clicks on the generate password button a prompt box appears to ask the user for their desired password length. As you can see in the screenshot below the employee put 5 which is too short, an alert box shows up telling the user that the password length must be between 8 & 128 characters. The third screenshot also shows console log message is the password is too long or short.
